# CLAUDE.md

## Git
- **🚫 NEVER EVER auto-commit code**
  - User MUST review code before commit
  - ONLY commit when user explicitly says "提交代码" or "commit"
  - NEVER commit automatically after completing tasks
- No AI traces in commit messages (no emojis, no "Generated with Claude Code", no "Co-Authored-By")
- Simple commit format: `<type>: <brief description>` (single line, no bullet points or detailed explanation)

## Vue
- ❌ Don't add comments
